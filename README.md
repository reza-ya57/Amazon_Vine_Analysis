## Summary
### By looking at the difference of 5-star review percentage between vine program and none-vine program we can say there is almost 8% negative bias in vine program for 5-star rating.<br> It is note a big difference but vine program would be more accurate and it should be worth for company to use this program for getting more accurate feedback from the customer. <br>
### By comparing the 1-star rating in both vine and none-vine program we can see more gap between these to program. The difference is about 10% so we can assume people in vine program write the review more accurate.
